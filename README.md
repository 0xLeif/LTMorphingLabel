# LTMorphingLabel
Yet another learning-by-doing Swift project cloning the original Morphing Label of iOS 8 introduced in WWDC 2014. It's easy to customize new morphing effects(see ```.EvaporateAndFade``` and ```.FallDownAndFade```).

## Demo:

## TODOs & Known issues
- [ ] Improve diff performance
- [ ] Text kerning
- [ ] Align to pixel
- [ ] Text shadow
- [ ] Multiline
- [ ] How to fade in/out Emoji?
- [ ] ```.FallDownAndFade``` is buggy

## Usage
1. Copy LTMorphingLabel folder to your iOS 8 project;
2. Change the class of a label from UILabel to LTMorphingLabel;
3. Programatically set a new String to its text property.

## Unit tests
Open the project with Xcode 6 then press command + u.
